# CIFAR10 Object Recognition
This project is a Deep Learning Classification task on [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. 
The network is a two-layer Convolutional Neural Network which using ReLU as its activation function and Cross Entropy as its Loss function. It is implemented in Tensorflow, and uses Tensorboard for visualization.
This model was trained on a GPU to obtain 65% accuracy on test data.
